the mouse-enter event listener works. 


Break down problem 


1. Figure out how to change color of element in grid. 
mouse-enter event listener. 

2. Dynamically add 16 boxes via js. 
Implemented for loop and boxes of equal size 
are being implemented 

3. Add event listener to all boxes. 
using forEach method added event listener to 
all boxes 

4. Make height and width dynamic 
    a. Get variable from user and square it. 
Get variable = i 
multiply i * i 
Start with variable 4 -

    b. Can either fix the height and width of 
    container and divide it equally 
fixed the height and width of container. Divided it 
by user input to divide equally. 
each box had height = total height divided by boxes 
width = total width divided by number of boxes

5. Add flex to body and auto margin left and right 

6. added function to prompt - if correct value 
(under 100) then function start takes place 

7. if node list for boxes is not empty or is true, 
then remove boxes 

8. Then create boxes with width, height and opacity of 0

9. using foreach to set up event listeners on all elements
with class box 

10. function to run is 
get opacity 
change it to number 
if opacity less than 1 increment by 0.1
set new opacity using box.style.opacity 
else just use box.style.backgroundColor to set color
tinked with math.floor(math.random() * 256) 
this got random rgb values 
used backticks ` to set rgb values for random colors. 
    



Create a 2 x 2 grid 
put it in flexbox 
put up event listener - for when mouse enters div 
Run function that changes color of the div when once mouse enters div
